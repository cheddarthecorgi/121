You already tested the app, so I'm not including a video.
The questions are:
  1) What is a problem at EHS?
  2) How could we fix it?
  3) What is your opinion on the school lunch?
  4) On a scale of 1-10, how toxic is the culture at EHS, 1 being not toxic at all and 10 being very toxic?
  5) On a scale of 1-10, how much do you think students use their phones, 1 being not at all, 10 being all the time?
The need to obtain this data is that since EHS is a new school, it is important to be able to gather a general consensus of the students and teachers for improving it.
The user can also input custom questions.
